# Checkpoint: Express & Mongoose

You may use outside resources during this checkpoint.

## Before You Start

**Fork** this repo to your personal github.

**Clone** it to your local machine.

**Before you begin anything, run `npm install`.**

To run the tests in the terminal, run `npm test`. Every time you make a change and save your files, you will need to manually re-run the tests. When you start, all of the tests will be failing; your goal is to make as many pass as you can in the hour provided.

> HINT: read the output of the failing tests.

## Instructions

For this checkpoint, you need to build a simple message board application. You will have a single model, Messages, with two properties: an Author and a Body.

We've provided a `package.json` file with the dependencies to run your tests; you will need to install everything else necessary to build your application server with Express and Mongoose.

Your application should have the following features:

* A home page that:
  * lists the most recently pushlished messages
  * has a link to create a new message
* A view for creating a new message that:
  * has a form for creating a new message
  * submits that form to your server to save the new message in your MongoDB database
* A show view for a message that:
  * Shows the message body and author

**NOTES:**
* You will need to add `module.exports = app` to the bottom of your `index.js` file for the tests to work (note: add this to the bottom of your `index.js` file, not the `index.js` file in the `tests/` directory).
* You will need to use `app.use(bodyParser.json())` in addition to the way you use bodyParser to process form submissions
* If your tests don't exit, try hitting `ctrl-c`.
* You do not (and should not) modify the tests in `tests/index.js`!

## Submission

Fork this repository and clone your fork locally. Commit as you go. When you are finished, push to GitHub.

**Wait until the end of the hour to make your Pull Request**
